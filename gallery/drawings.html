<p> Hi everyone, glad you visited my site. :)
I'm Melanie and after i took a veeery long break from drawing (almost 13 years), i finally started again. It's lots of fun, but i'm quite rusty so my drawings are far from being good. But i really hope to improve througout the years. :3
That's why constructive critism is always welcomed.<br>

I try to draw as much as possible in my spare time. Also, i like to try new stuff, so while most of my drawings will be in Anime/Manga style, expect to see something else from time to time. :)

<h2> Gothic Umbreon Trainer Lineart </h2>
<h3> finishing date 2017-04-03</h3>
<p> This was my first picture after not drawing for almost 13 years. It was my very first time doing digital art as well. <br>
To be honest, it didn't turn out too well. I felt extremly rusty back then and using a tablet was quite a drag as well, so the picture turned out really sloppy. You notice immediatly that i struggled a lot with drawing proper lines.
But uh, i tried my best and somehow made it. <br>
Even tho this drawing has a ton of flaws and mistakes, it is still one of the most important pictures to me. It got me hooked up with "art"and motivated me to pick up drawing as a hobby again. <br>
That's why despite everything i really like this picture.
