<section id="introduction">Hi everyone, glad you visited my site. :)
I'm Melanie and after i took a veeery long break from drawing (almost 13 years), i finally started again. It's lots of fun, but i'm quite rusty so my drawings are far from being good. But i really hope to improve througout the years. :3
That's why constructive critism is always welcomed.<br>

I try to draw as much as possible in my spare time. Also, i like to try new stuff, so while most of my drawings will be in Anime/Manga style, expect to see something else from time to time. :)
